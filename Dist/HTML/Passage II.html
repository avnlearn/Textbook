    <p><strong>Read the following paragraph and answer the questions that
        follow:</strong></p>
    <p>Once upon a time, king Brahmadatta wanted a place which would stand
      on a single pillar. He thought it would be one of the greatest wonders
      of the world. He needed a strong tree for the pillar. He sent hundreds
      of wood-cutters all over the forest to find such a tree.</p>
    <p>The wood-cutters looked everywhere. At last, they found a tall and
      magnificent sal tree in the middle of the forest. The wood cutter got
      ready to cut down the tree. The tree grew very sad that it would die the
      next day. That night the tree spoke to the king in his dream. It said to
      him, “O King! Can you tell your wood-cutters to cut me in parts.</p>
    <p>First my top branches then my middle branches and then the trunk?”
      The king was surprised. “Why?” he asked. The tree told him, “If they cut
      me at one stroke, I might fall on the other trees and hurt them. So cut
      me limb by limb. It will spare the other trees being hurt”. The king was
      moved by the tree‟s kindness. He decided not to cut the tree to build
      his palace.</p>
