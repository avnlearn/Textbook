# 1. The Earth In The Solar System

The Solar System - The sun, eight planets, satellites and some other celestial bodies known as asteroids and meteoroids for the solar system.
Rotation - One Spin on Axis
Revolution - One Orbit Around Sun
Inner Planets - Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars

Dwarf Planets - Till recently (August 2006), Pluto was also considered a planet. However, in a meeting of the International Astronomical Union, a decision was taken that Pluto like other celestial objects (Ceres, 2003 UB 313 ) discovered in the recent past may be called 'dwarf planets."
The Earth - In size, it is the fifth largest planet. Its shape is described as a Geoid. Geoid means an earth-like shape. Conditions favourable to support life are probably found only on the earth. The earth is neither too hot nor too cold. It has water and air. It is called a blue planet.
