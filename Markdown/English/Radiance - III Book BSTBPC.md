# I WONDER

## A. WARMER

> There are many things that we wonder at. Tell your class some such things that you have ofter wondered at.

    I wonder why the grass is green,
    And why the wind is never seen.
    Who taught the birds to build a nest?
    And told the trees to take rest?



    O, when the moon is not quite round,
    Where can the missing bit be found?
    Who lights the stars, when they blow out,
    And makes the lightning flash about?
    Who paints the rainbow in the sky?
    And hang the fluffy clouds'so high?

    Why is it now, do you suppose,
    That Dad won't tell me, if he knows?

'आई वन्डर' एक आश्चर्यजनक, अनुभूत कविता है। प्रस्तुत कविता एक 'बालक के कौतूहलपूर्ण मस्तिष्क से सम्बन्धित है। कविता का वक्ता एक बालक है। वह अपने चारों ओर देखता है और उसके मस्तिष्क में कई प्रश्‍न उमड़ने-घुमड़ने लगते हैं। उसके पास कई प्रश्‍न हैं। घास हरे रंग की क्यों है? क्यों हवा दिखती नहीं? ऐसे ही कई प्रश्‍न हैं उसके दिमाग में। अंत में, वह बच्चा स्वयं को आश्वस्त भी करता है, यकीन भी दिलाता है कि यदि उसके पिता के पास इन प्रश्‍नों के उत्तर होंगे, तो वे उसे जरूरी बताएँगे।

# 2. SLEEP

## A. WARMER

> Why do we sleep? Do all persons sleep for the same amount of time? Do you ever have dreams? If yes, narrate the dreams which you like dislike most. Why do you think we have dreams?

Nobody knows why we sleep, but we all need to. Sleep helps our body and brain develop and grow. Our body needs sleep to stay healthy and fight sickness. During sleep, our muscles, bones and skin can grow, and muscles, skin and other parts can fix injuries. Our brain needs sleep.Sleep helps our brain toremember what we leam. It also helps brain to pay attention and concentrate.

There are no rules about how much sleep is necessary, but an average ⋅ adult sleeps for seven hours and twenty minutes. About 8% of adults are happy with five hours or less of sleep and 4% want ten hours or more. Children at the age of 5 to ]2 years need 0 to I] hours of sleep each night. Babies need between fourteen to eighteen hours, whereas the elderly need less than they did when young; they often take a nap during the day.

There are five stages in one sleep cycle. Each sleep cycle takes about 90 minutes. The sleep cycle is repeated 5 or 6 times during thenight. During the stages { and 2, you first fall asleep, but are not yet ina deep sleep. During the stages 3 and 4, you are in a deep sleep. Your breathing and heart rate slow down, and your body is motionless. During the fifth stage, your brain is active and you dream. You dream during the stage of sleep called Rapid Eye Movement or REM. During the REM, your eyes move under your eyelids rapidly.

Normal sleep is made up of two alternating phases — phase one in-
'volves no dreaming; usually it occurs in the early part of the night.

Phase two involves dreaming; it occurs mostly in the later part of the
night for varying periods of time. If you wake up during this phase, you will
almost certainly remember your dreams.

When we sleep, the bodily functions slow down; body temperature falls. This is because our body keeps toa regulat 24 hour cycle during which body temperature rises and falls at fixed times. Normally, body temperature is lowest in the middle of the night and the highest in the afternoon

When you get enough sleep you can pay attention better in school, be creative and think of new ideas, fight sickness so you stay- healthy; be in a good mood and get along well with friends and family. If you don't get enough sleep, you can forget what you learn, have trouble making decisions, be in a bad mood, have trouble playing games, have trouble listening to parents and teachers, and be less patient with friends, brothers and sisters.

Sometimes everyone has difficulty in sleeping, but if you miss a couple of hours of sleep, no harm is done. You may feel tired and irritable the next day, but the body soon makes up for the loss. However, if you try to stay awake night after night, you soon begin to behave strangely. You lose the ability to concentrate and your judgement gets impaired. You begin to imagine strange things and your behaviour becomes deranged.

A lot of people have serious sleep problems. Some people find that. they cannot sleep: some wake up in the middle of the night or too early in the morning. There are a number of causes. Worry and depression are the most common causes. All kinds of things in the environment can affect sleep - noise, light, heat, cold or new surroundings. Pain in illness can also keep people awake. Most of us can accept temporary sleeplessness without seeking help, many people become addicted to sleeping pills but sleeping pills do not cure the disorder of sleeplessness called insomnia. It is better to avoid them if we can. It is much better to identify the problem and remove it.

Here in sentence (a) there is only one subject (a lot of people) and a

# THE RAJA'S DREAM

## A. WARMER

> Have you ever had a funny strange dream? Share it with your classmates. Teil them if it had any connection with reality.

Raja Krishna Chandra often heard his courtiers complaining that Gopal loved to make everyone appear like a fool. There was hardly anyone in the court who had not at one time or another tried to get their backs at Gopal but always ended up looking like utter idiots. The Raja knew that this was true. It often rankled him that without uttering a single objectionable word the jester had made him feel silly more than once. So one day Krishna Chandra decided to amuse himself by baiting Gopal.

"Ah, Gopal, I have had a strange dream", announced the Raja the
next day as soon as he saw, Gopal in the court. And everyone fell silent in |
order to listen to the king's dream. ⋅

"I dreamt Gopal, that you and I were going for a walk and we reached a place where there were two pools. One of the pools were filled with kheer made of rich thick milk and the other full of horribly smelly dung. Suddenly, I fell into the milky pool and you into rotting muck."

On hearing this, the courtiers buist out laughing. They obviously relished the thought of the jester covered from head to toe in muck.

Gopal stood unruffled, waiting for everyone to finish laughing. And then surprised everyone by telling the king with great humility that he had exactly the same dream.

The king looked questioningly at Gopal and asked, "You mean
⋅ everything happened in your dream just the way they happened in mine?"

"Yes, Maharaj", replied Gopal, "only your dream finished earlier. My
dream continued a little longer. I saw both of us coming out of the pool. You
covered in kheer and I covered in muck and then I saw that you were licking
me and I was licking you in order to clean each other."

The courtiers almost choeked. when they heard this. But unfortunately for everyone, the king was in a good mood and did not mind his legs being pulled alittle. In fact he had-a good laugh at Gopal's wit.

> 3. Where do you buy ice-cream?

When summer's in the city,
And brick's blaze of heat,
The ice-cream man with his little cart
Goes trundling down the street.
Beneath his round umbrella,
Oh, what a joyful sight,
To see him fill the cones with mounds
Of cooling brown and white;

Vanilla, chocolate, strawberry,
Or chilly things to drink
From bottles full of frosty-fizz,
Green, orange, white, or pink.
His cart might be a flower bed,

Of roses and sweet peas,
The way the children cluster round
As thick as honeybees.

Once there was a'rich and powerful king. He thought that no one in the world was as powerful as he was. But he told no one about it. One day he began to wonder whether other could guess what he was thinking. So he called all his officers and servants and asked them to tell him what thought was in his heart. Many of them made guesses. But noone could satisfy the king with his answer.

Then the king ordered his minister to find someone who could guess his thought. He gave the minister exactly a month's time to find that person. The minister searched everywhere but he could not find anyone who could guess the thought in the king's mind. As the month was coming to a close, the minister became quite desperate. But his daughter cheered him up by saying 0 that she would find the right man for the job. "All right, let's see what youcan do," said the minister.

When the appointed day arrived, the minister's daughter brought home a fool. The man was a shepherd in their farm. The young woman asked her father to take the shepherd to the king. The minister was shocked at his daughter's choice. But since he trusted his daughter, he took the shepherd to the king's court.

The court had already assembled. The minister presented the shepherd to the king. When the shepherd lifted his eyes to look at the king, the king held up one finger. At this, the shepherd held two fingers. Then the king held up three fingers, but at this the fool shook his head violently and tried to run away. The minister could not.understand what,happened. He begged the king to explain things to him.

"When I held up one finger," said the king; "I asked the man whether I alone was king. By holding up two fingers, he reminded me that there is also God, who is at least as powerful as Tam. Then I asked him whether there was a third, and he strongly denied the existence of a third. This man really read my thoughts. I have been thinking that I alone was powerful, but he has reminded me that there is also God; but no third."

## TESS BUYS A MIRACLE

## 1. WARMER

> 1. Have you ever seen lucky things that happen to you or to someone known to you? Talk about them to the class.
> 2. Can you make lucky things happen whenever you want? If yes, what good things will you like to happen in your life?

One day eight-year-old Tess overheard her parents talking about her
little brother Andrew. She came to know that Andrew was very sick and that
her parents didn't have enough money for his treatment. Tess heard her
father say: "Only a miracle can save him now."

Tess started thinking about what she had heard. She went to her room
and took out a jar from her cupboard. There were some coins in it. She
counted the money carefully.

Then Tess put the money into a purse and made her way to a drugstore.
The chemist saw her but didn't pay her any attention. When Tess continued
to stand before the counter, he said to her, sounding rather annoyed, "What
do you want? I'm talking to my brother who has Just arrived from Chicago!"
"T want to buy a miracle," said Tess. "My brother Andrew is really
sick. He has something bad growing inside his head and my father says that
only a miracle can save him now. Can you tell me how much miracle costs?'

The chemist's brother, a well-dressed man, had heard the conversation
between his brother and the little girl. He turned to Tess and asked, "What
kind of miracle does your brother need?"

"Don't know," replied Tess, her eyes full of tears. "He's really sick
and Mummy says he needs an operation. But Dad can't pay for it, so I want
to use my own money." ( ⋅

"How much money do you have?" asked the well-dres sedman. .

^€ dollar and eleven cents," replied Tess.

"Wonderful!" said the man, smiling. "A dollar and eleven cents - that's
the exact price of a miracle for your little brother." He took Tess's money in
one hand and held her hand with the other, saying, "Take me to your house.
I want to see your brother. Let me see if I have the kind of miracle you
need."

The chemist's brother was. Dr Carlton Armstrong , a famous
neurosurgeon. He had Andrew admitted to hospital, where he operated on
him. Within a few weeks Andrew was back at home anid was doing well.

One day Tess's mother said to her husband, "I wonder how much
Andrew's surgery cost. Dr. Armstrong wouldn't take any money from us!"

On hearing this, Tess smiled to herself. She knew exactly how mucha
miracle cost. One dollar and eleven cents ..... plus the faith of a little child.

  | When reporting speech, the tense usually changes. This.is because when we use reported'speech, we are usually talking about a time in the past (because 'obviously the person who spoke originally spoke in the past). The verbs therefore usually have to be inthe past too. In reported speech, we need to use the past tense form of the verb. In direct speech the presént tense is used. As you can see, in the above sentence 'am' changes to''was' wheii-we use reported

\_ You can use the present tense in the reported speech if you want to say that
something is still true. For example, my name has always been and will always be-
Aniket so: = −⋅ | ∙⋅⋅ ⋅

"My name is Aniket" He said (that) his name was Aniket.

You can also use the present tense if you are talking about a future event.

Time change

If the reported sentence contains an expression of time, you must

# 8. MEASURE FOR MEASURE

## A. WARMER

Have you ever met or seen a person who may be excellent in certain things, but is asked to do things in which he/she has no experience? How did he/she perform? Were you amused/ annoyed to see his/ her performance? Tell your classmates the . lesson that you learnt from this experience. ⋅

Krishna Deva Raya was known for his patronage of poets and scholars.
He was equally fond of fine arts. Once he came to know about a brilliant artist
named Raja Varma. He invited Raja Varma to the court and asked him to draw
his portrait. + १
। The king was very pleased with the artist when his portrait was ready. -
In the portrait, the majestic and handsome king seemed to have come alive
within the frame. ⋅

Apart from this portrait Raja Varma drew images of famous characters
from Puranas, of men and women, and so on. He became well known for his
skills. He became close and dear to the king.

Overwhelmed by joy, Krishna Deva Raya called the artist and asked

⋅ him what he wanted. When Raja Varma did not reply, the king, on the spur of
a generous impulse, rewarded him with the chief ministership.

Though Raja Varma was a good man and a brilliant artist, he had no
experience, whatsoever, of administration. Soon everything was thrown into
disorder because of his hasty decisions and bad management of the state affairs.
Though people were unhappy about his administration, they did not dare
complain to the king because the king was very fond of him.

The elders of the town finally approached and sought Tenali Raman's
help in getting rid of the new and inept chief minister.

Tenali Raman assured them, "I shall soon find a harmless way to remove ⋅
the artist from the ministership."

After a few weeks, Tenali Raman invited the king, the queens and some
courtiers to his house for lunch. Meanwhile, he found a very good carpenter
and put him on the job of preparing a grand feast for the king. .

The king and others sat for lunch and at Tenali Raman's order, the
carpenter began serving them. As soon as they put the first morsel of food in
their mouths, the people began to request for water again and again.

Soon after tasting the food, the king realised that the food was badly
cooked and was unbearably hot. He was angry.

"Raman, who has cooked this food? Do you want all to suffer and die
by eating this horrible food?" .

In his usual humble way Tenali Raman said, "I beg your Majesty's
forgiveness." Then he showed carpenter to the king. I have never come across
such an excellent carpenter, and I have put him on the job of cooking the lunch
for today's feast."

The king began laughing loudly. "Have you lost all sense, Raman? A ⋅
good carpenter should be employed to work on wood but not on food. How
did you get this funny idea?"
Tenali Raman asked the king, "Lord! If an artist can become a chief
minister, can't a carpenter become a cook?"
The king at once understood that Tenali Raman got a carpenter to cook
the food to make him realise his error in making Raja Varma the chief minister.

the "valley of rice".
