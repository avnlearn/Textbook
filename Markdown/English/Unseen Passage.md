**1.Read the passage and answer the questions that follow :**

The natural life span of a domesticated horse is about 25--30 years, 10
years down from what it was in the wild. You can tell a horse's age from
the number of teeth he has. They get all their teeth by the age of 5,
after which those teeth just get longer. Horses have close to 360 degree
all round vision. The only place they cannot see is directly behind or
right in front of them, which is why it's dangerous to stand behind a
horse. If they feel something behind them, they may kick first and ask
questions later! It also means that they cannot see a jump once they are
about four feet from it, and have to rely on memory as to its height and
shape! Each of the horse's two eyes works independently wherever a
horse's ear points it is the direction where the horse is looking. A
horse is able to sleep standing up as he is able to lock his leg muscles
so that he doesn't fall asleep.

Recycling is an important way of caring for our planet. Human beings use
many new products every year and create a lot of garbage. By recycling
the things we don't want, we can reduce the need to make new things.
Metals, glass and paper can be easily recycled.

Apart from recycling, there are other things that we must do to save our
natural resources. We should reduce the amount of plastic, paper,
electricity and water that we use. Keep plastic bags carefully and reuse
them instead of buying new ones. Write on both sides of a paper and do
not print things unless necessary. We should remember to switch off
fans, lights and electrical appliances when they are not being used.

**9. Read the following paragraph and answer the questions that
follow:**

What do three hearts, eight arms, and one huge brain add up to? An
octopus, a creature that can do amazing things. Octopuses are extremely
intelligent. They can learn new things just like humans. They've even
learned a few tricks to get them out of sticky situations. If an octopus
is threatened by a predator, such as a shark or bird, it can use some
pretty incredible skills to get away. Octopuses don't have teeth or
sharp claws to defend themselves. Instead, they use more clever ways to
fool their attackers. Octopuses like to hide themselves in the sand on
the bottom of the ocean floor. Well, the octopus is like a chameleon
because it can change the colour of its skin to match the sand and this
colour change, or camouflage, happens in less than a minute.

Octopuses are invertebrates, meaning they don't have backbones. Another
way an octopus can hide is by shooting ink. The ink forms a cloud that
hides the octopus. By the time the ink clears and the predator can see
again, the octopus has swum away or hidden. It's very much like a
magician doing a vanishing act.

A young crow had fallen from its neat and was fluttering about on the
road. It was in danger there. So, I brought it home. It was in a sorry
condition. We did not expect it to live. But my grandfather and I tried
our best to save his life. We fed it by opening its beak gently with a
pencil. We pushed in a little bread and milk, then removed the pencil to
allow it to swallow. As a result, the young crow was soon on its way to
recovery. We were then prepared to let him go. We thought he would want
to be free and go with other crows. Instead, he made himself at home in
our house. My grandmother, Aunt Mable and even some of my grandfather's
other pets did not like this. But there was no way of getting rid of the
bird. We were not sure if he was a male bird, but we called him Caesar.
