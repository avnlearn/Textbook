**Read the following paragraph and answer the questions that follow:**

Once upon a time, king Brahmadatta wanted a place which would stand on a
single pillar. He thought it would be one of the greatest wonders of the
world. He needed a strong tree for the pillar. He sent hundreds of
wood-cutters all over the forest to find such a tree.

The wood-cutters looked everywhere. At last, they found a tall and
magnificent sal tree in the middle of the forest. The wood cutter got
ready to cut down the tree. The tree grew very sad that it would die the
next day. That night the tree spoke to the king in his dream. It said to
him, "O King! Can you tell your wood-cutters to cut me in parts.

First my top branches then my middle branches and then the trunk?" The
king was surprised. "Why?" he asked. The tree told him, "If they cut me
at one stroke, I might fall on the other trees and hurt them. So cut me
limb by limb. It will spare the other trees being hurt". The king was
moved by the treeâ€Ÿs kindness. He decided not to cut the tree to build
his palace.
