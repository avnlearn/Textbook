**Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow:**

I was ten years old then, and my brother, Nick, was fourteen. For both of us this buying of a gift for our mother on Mother's Day was a time of excitement and great importance. It was our first gift to her. We were very poor. It was just after the First World War and we lived in difficult times of trouble. Our father worked sometimes as a waiter. Birthday and Christmas gifts were taken care of by him as well as he could, but such a thing as a Mother's Day gift was out-of-the-ordinary luxury. But we had been lucky, Nick and myself. A second-hand furniture store had opened on the block, and deliveries were made by means of loading the furniture on a pushcart which we carefully pushed through traffic, to the customer's home. We got a nickel each and, perhaps, a tip. I remember how Nick's thin, dark face lighted up with the joy of the present. He had first thought of it in school; and the thought of surprise and giving grew in him, and me, and we were highly excited.
