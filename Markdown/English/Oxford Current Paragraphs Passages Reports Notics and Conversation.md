## Section - II : Passages

### 1. Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow:

I was ten years old then, and my brother, Nick, was fourteen. For both of us this buying of a gift for our mother on Mother's Day was a time of excitement and great importance. It was our first gift to her. We were very poor. It was just after the First World War and we lived in difficult times of trouble. Our father worked sometimes as a waiter. Birthday and Christmas gifts were taken care of by him as well as he could, but such a thing as a Mother's Day gift was out-of-the-ordinary luxury. But we had been lucky, Nick and myself. A second-hand furniture store had opened on the block, and deliveries were made by means of loading the furniture on a pushcart which we carefully pushed through traffic, to the customer's home. We got a nickel each and, perhaps, a tip. I remember how Nick's thin, dark face lighted up with the joy of the present. He had first thought of it in school; and the thought of surprise and giving grew in him, and me, and we were highly excited.

### 2. Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow:

The landlords of India, as is well known, are largely the creation of British imperialism. The bigger landlords have always solidly stood with imperialism and have been its strongest props in the countryside. Nationalism has no meaning to these people - except jobs in the higher services; and if any political power is to be given to Indians on account of nationalist forces gathering strength, then the balance of such power. They themselves are not interested in opposing or even agitating against imperialism. Their entry into politics is merely to ensure that their interests do not suffer on account of any power being 'transferred' to Indian hands. No one with the least political understanding or experience can talk of unity with the landlords. Here is the second breach in national unity.

### 2. Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow:

What does it mean to eat intelligently? It means exercising enough to keep your body from accumulating enough fat but not so much that you get incredibly thin. Dieting is something that you should never resort to. The growing body requires all the essential food groups. Eat well, eat enough and eat sensibly. 

Skipping meals can lead to stomach ulcers. Your body pours acid into your stomach as it digests food. Eating too little or not eating at regular times can result in the acid tearing away the tissue that lines the stomach. It doesn't matter if you eat a few big meals or many small ones, but eat at regular times everyday. Fast foods, soft drinks, excessive consumption of fat, meat products, liquor, etc. have to be replaced by the traditional foods of Indians such as cereals, wheat, vegetables, pulses, rice and milk.

8. Read the passage given below and answer the questions
that follow:
The great advantage of early rising is that one can start
one’s work long before others. The early riser has done a
large amount of hard work before other men have got out of
bed. In the early morning, the mind is fresh and no sounds
or noises disturb our attention. The work done at that time
is
generally
well
done.
Also,
one
finds

exercise in the fresh morning air. Exercise supplies him with
good deal of energy that enables him to work hard until the
evening. By beginning so early, he knows that he has plenty
of time to do his work thoroughly. He has not to hurry over
any part of his work. He gets to sleep long before midnight.
At that time, sleep is most refreshing. After a sound night's
rest, he rises early next morning in good health for the
labour of a new day.
