# Direct and Inverse Proportions

1. Observe the tables given below and in each one find whether x and y are proportional:

   |  x  |  3  |  5  |  8  | 11  | 26  |
   | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
   |  y  |  9  | 15  | 24  | 33  | 78  |

   |  x  | 2.5 |  4  | 7.5 | 10  | 14  |
   | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
   |  y  | 10  | 16  | 30  | 40  | 42  |

   |  x  |  5  |  7  |  9  | 15  | 18  | 25  |
   | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
   | 15  | 21  | 27  | 60  | 72  | 75  |

2. If x and y are directly proportional, find the values of x~1~,x~2~ and y~1~, in the table given below:

   |  x  |  3  | x~1~ | x~2~ |  10  |
   | :-: | :-: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
   |  y  | 72  | 120  | 192  | y~1~ |

3. Observe the tables given below and in each case find whether x and y are inversely proportional:

   |  x  |  6  | 10  | 14  | 16  |
   | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
   |  y  |  9  | 15  | 21  | 24  |

   |  x  |  5  |  9  | 15  |  3  | 45  |
   | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
   |  y  | 18  | 10  |  6  | 30  |  2  |

   |  x  |  9  |  3  |  6  | 36  |
   | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
   |  y  |  4  | 12  |  9  |  1  |

4. If x and y are inversely proportional, find th e values of x~1~, x~2~, y~1~, and y~2~ in the table given below:

   |  x  |  8   | x~1~ | 16  | x~2~ |  80  |
   | :-: | :--: | :--: | :-: | :--: | :--: |
   |  y  | y~1~ |  4   |  5  |  2   | y~2~ |
