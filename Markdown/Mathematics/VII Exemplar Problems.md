# 5. Lines And Angles

## (A) Main Concepts and Results

An angle is formed when two lines or rays or line segments meet or
intersect.

- When the sum of the measures of two angles is 90°, the angles are called complementary angles. Each of them is called complement of the other.
- When the sum of the measures of two angles is 180°, the angles are called supplementary angles. Each of them is called supplement of the other.
- Two angles are called adjacent angles, if they have a common vertex and a common arm but no common interior points.
- A linear pair is a pair of adjacent angles whose non-common sides are opposite rays.
- When two lines intersect, the vertically opposite angles so formed are equal.
- When two lines are intersected by a transversal, eight angles are formed. These angles can be classified as 4 interior angles, 4 exterior angles, 4 pairs of corresponding angles, 2 pairs of alternate interior angles, 2 pairs of alternate exterior angles and two pairs of interior angles on the same side of the transversal.
- If two parallel lines are intersected by a transversal,
  (i) each pair of corresponding angles is equal.
  (ii) each pair of alternate interior angles is equal.
  (iii) each pair of interior angles on the same side of the transversal is supplementary.
- Converses of the above results are also true.

# 6. Triangle

## (A) Main Concepts and Results

- The six elements of a triangle are its three angles and the three sides.
- The line segment joining a vertex of a triangle to the mid point of its opposite side is called a median of the triangle. A triangle has 3 medians.
- The perpendicular line segment from a vertex of a triangle to its opposite side is called an altitude of the triangle. A triangle has 3 altitudes.
- An exterior angle of a triangle is formed, when a side of a triangle is produced.
- The measure of any exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of its two interior opposite angles.
- The sum of the three angles of a triangle is 180°.
- A triangle is said to be equilateral, if each of its sides has the same length.
- In an equilateral triangle, each angle has measure 60°.
- A triangle is said to be isosceles if at least two of its sides are of same length.
- The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is always greater than the length of the third side.
- The difference of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is always smaller than the length of the third side.
- In a right-angled triangle, the side opposite to the right angle is called the hypotenuse and the other two sides are called its legs or arms.
- In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares on its legs.
- Two plane figures, say, F 1 and F2 are said to be congruent, if the trace-copy of F1 fits exactly on that of F2. We write this as F1 ≅ F2.
- Two line segments, say AB and CD , are congruent, if they have equal lengths. We write this as AB ≅ CD . However, it is common to write it as AB = CD .
- Two angles, say ∠ABC and ∠PQR, are congruent, if their measures are equal. We write this as ∠ABC ≅ ∠PQR or as m ∠ABC = m∠PQR or simply as ∠ABC = ∠PQR.
- Under a given correspondence, two triangles are congruent, if the three sides of the one are equal to the three sides of the other (SSS).
- Under a given correspondence, two triangles are congruent if two sides and the angle included between them in one of the triangles are equal to the two sides and the angle included between them of the other triangle (SAS).
- Under a given correspondence, two triangles are congruent if two angles and the side included between them in one of the triangles are equal to the two angles and the side included between them of the other triangle (ASA).
- Under a given correspondence, two right-angled triangles are congruent if the hypotenuse and a leg (side) of one of the triangles are equal to the hypotenuse and one of the leg (side) of the other triangle (RHS).

# 10. Algebraic expression

## (A) Main Concepts and Results

1. Algebraic expression is formed from variables and constants using different operations.
2. Expressions are made up of terms.
3. A term is the product of factors. Factors may be numerical as well as algebraic (literal).
4. Coefficient is the numerical factor in a term. Sometimes, any factor in a term is called the coefficient of the remaining part of the term.
5. The terms having the same algebraic factors are called like terms.
6. The terms having different algebraic factors are called unlike terms.
7. Expression with one term is called a 'Monomial'.
8. Expression with two unlike terms is called a 'Binomial'.
9. Expression with three unlike terms is called a 'Trinomial'.
10. In general, an expression with one or more than one term (with non-negative integral exponents of the variables) is called a 'Polynomial'.
11. The sum (or difference) of two like terms is a like term with coefficient equal to the sum (or difference) of coefficients of the two like terms.
12. When we add (or subtract) two algebraic expressions, the like terms are added (or subtracted) and the unlike terms are written as they are.
13. To find the value of an expression, we substitute the values of the variables in the expression and then simplify.
14. Rules and formulas in mathematics are written in a concise and general form using algebraic expressions.

# 12. Practical Geometry Symmetry And Visualising Solid Shapes

## (A) Main Concepts and Results

- Let a line 'l' and a point P not lying on it be given. By using properties of a transversal and parallel lines, a line which passes through the point P and parallel to 'l', can be drawn.
- A triangle can be drawn if any one of the following sets of measurements are given :
  (i) Three sides (SSS).
  (ii) Two sides and the angle between them (SAS).
  (iii) Two angles and a side (AAS) or (ASA).
  (iv) The hypotenuse and a leg in the case of a right-angled triangle (RHS).
- A figure has line symmetry, if there is a line about which the figure may be folded so that the two parts of the figure will coincide with each other.
- Regular polygons have equal sides and equal angles. They have multiple (i.e., more than one) lines of symmetry.
- Each regular polygon has as many lines of symmetry as it has sides.
- Mirror reflection leads to symmetry, under which the left-right orientation have to be taken care of.
- Rotation turns an object about a fixed point. This fixed point is called the centre of rotation.
- The angle by which the object rotates is the angle of rotation. Rotation may be clockwise or anti-clockwise.
- A half-turn means rotation by 180°. A quarter-turn means rotation by 90°.
- If, after a rotation, a figure or an object coincides with the original position, we say that it has a rotational symmetry.
- In a complete turn (of 360°), the number of times. the figure coincides with its original position is called its order of rotational symmetry.
- Every figure has a rotational symmetry of order 1 (i.e. a rotational symmetry of angle 360°). In such a case it is considered that the figure has no rotational symmetry.
- Some shapes have only one line of symmetry, like the letter E; some have only rotational symmetry, like the letter S; and some have both vertical and horizontal lines of symmetry, like the letter H.
- Plane figures are of two-dimensions (2-D) and the solid shapes are of three-dimensions (3-D).
- The corners of a solid shape are called its vertices, the line segments/curves which form its skeleton are its edges and its flat surfaces are its faces.
  Fig. 12.1
- A net is a skeleton-outline of a solid that can be folded to make the solid.
- Solid shapes can be drawn on a flat surface. This is called a 2–D representation of a 3–D solid (shape).
- Two types of sketches of a solid are possible:
  (i) An oblique sketch which does not have proportional measurements.
  (ii) An isometric sketch which is drawn on an isometric dot paper. In this sketch of the solid, the measurements are kept proportional.
- Different sections of a solid can be viewed in many ways:
  (i) By cutting or slicing, the shape, which would result in the cross-section of the solid.
  (ii) By observing a 2-D shadow of a 3-D shape.
  (iii) By looking at the shape from different positions-the front-view, the side-view and the top-view.
