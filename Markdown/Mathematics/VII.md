## WHAT HAVE WE DISCUSSED?

1. The collection, recording and presentation of data help us organise our experiences and draw inferences from them.
2. Before collecting data we need to know what we would use it for.
3. The data that is collected needs to be organised in a proper table, so that it becomes easy to understand and interpret.
4. Average is a number that represents or shows the central tendency of a group of observations or data.
5. Arithmetic mean is one of the representative values of data.
6. Mode is another form of central tendency or representative value. The mode of a set of observations is the observation that occurs most often.
7. Median is also a form of representative value. It refers to the value which lies in the middle of the data with half of the observations above it and the other half below it.
8. A bar graph is a representation of numbers using bars of uniform widths.
9. Double bar graphs help to compare two collections of data at a glance.
10. There are situations in our life, that are certain to happen, some that are impossible and some that may or may not happen. The situation that may or may not happen has a chance of happening.

4. Construct ∆ABC such that AB = 2.5 cm, BC = 6 cm and AC = 6.5 cm. Measure ∠B.

## DO THIS

Let us now construct another triangle ABC such that AB = 3 cm, BC = 5.5 cm and m∠ABC = 60°. Take a cut out of ∆ABC and place it on ∆PQR.What do we observe? We observe that ∆ABC exactly coincides with ∆PQR. Thus, if two sides and the included angle of one triangle are equal to the corresponding two sides and the included angle of another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent. This is SAS congruency rule which we have learnt in our earlier chapter. (Note that the triangles have been constructed when their two sides and the angle included between these two sides are given.)
